In this project of Analysis & Design of User Interfaces (SEG3125), I had the opportunity to build a small service business website. I chose to build a salon that allowed me to design a UI corresponding to a userâ€™s goals of obtaining a particular service at a particular time with a particular expert. Users also have access to the location of the business with its opening hours, as well as a description of services and their costs. I had the opportunity to do a prototype (mockup) of the human-machine interaction for the salon business. After that, I implemented an improved version of the human-machine interaction taking into account all feedback received, this is a high-fidelity prototype. I used JavaScript, HTML & CSS using bootstrap for this step.
